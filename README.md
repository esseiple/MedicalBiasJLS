Final project for ML

Abstract
We aim to address the relationship between disease and procedures and sex and race in healthcare and how it reflects environmental inequities. Our approach is to train a model to generate risk likelihood scores and evaluate the relationship between different diseases and characteristics indicative of societal inequalities. We will then analyze the implications of these risk factors for fairness in the healthcare system. Our project will be successful if we are able to generate meaningful risk likelihood scores and have meaningful evaluation of their fairness.

Motivation and Question
We have been inspired by the Bias Replication Study that we discussed during lecture. We hope to look beyond healthcare operations to see actual societal implications. We are excited to use data that represents what is happening in our healthcare systems in real time. Algorithmic bias is incredibly problematic, and can further bias in the real world. Our machine learning model will allow us to reflect on bias in our healthcare and help us analyze the fairness in the system.

We have a synthetic data set, developed for an Introduction to Biomedical Science Textbook, for which we can develop predictive and exploratory models that would help us examine relationships between disease diagnoses and larger scale trends and impacts.
