Final project for ML

Abstract
We aim to address the relationship between disease and procedures and sex and race in healthcare and how it reflects environmental inequities. Our approach is to train a model to generate risk likelihood scores and evaluate the relationship between different diseases and characteristics indicative of societal inequalities. We will then analyze the implications of these risk factors for fairness in the healthcare system. Our project will be successful if we are able to generate meaningful risk likelihood scores and have meaningful evaluation of their fairness.
