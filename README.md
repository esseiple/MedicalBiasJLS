# MedicalBiasJLS
Final project for ML

Abstract
We aim to address the relationship between disease and procedures and sex and race in healthcare and how it reflects environmental inequities. Our approach is to train a model to generate risk likelihood scores and evaluate the relationship between different diseases and characteristics indicative of societal inequalities. We will then analyze the implications of these risk factors for fairness in the healthcare system. Our project will be successful if we are able to generate meaningful risk likelihood scores and have meaningful evaluation of their fairness.

Motivation and Question
We have been inspired by the Bias Replication Study that we discussed during lecture. We hope to look beyond healthcare operations to see actual societal implications. We are excited to use data that represents what is happening in our healthcare systems in real time. Algorithmic bias is incredibly problematic, and can further bias in the real world. Our machine learning model will allow us to reflect on bias in our healthcare and help us analyze the fairness in the system.

We have a synthetic data set, developed for an Introduction to Biomedical Science Textbook, for which we can develop predictive and exploratory models that would help us examine relationships between disease diagnoses and larger scale trends and impacts. 

Planned Deliverables
Our deliverables would include multiple aspects. A python package containing the development of our risk-assessment model. A Jupyter notebook consisting of initial visualizations of data and illustrating the use of our developed Python package to analyze our synthetic medical data. A written component would contain our analyses of our model’s risk score outputs, any biases reflected in our model, an evaluation of the relationship between different diseases and characteristics indicative of societal inequalities as well as a discussion of the 3 views of fairness as it pertains to our project. 

Partial success in our project would mean creating a risk-assessment model without analyzing the implications of our findings. To be fully successful in our final project we will need to fully assess multiple options to find the most optimal algorithm to classify our data. Secondly, we will analyze the fairness of our results in the context of existing societal inequities and biases.
Resources Required
Our project utilizes a synthetic data set created for an Introduction to Biomedical Data Science Textbook. The data was created using Synthea, a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Synthea’s mission is “to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare.” This is also much easier to access than real patient data.
